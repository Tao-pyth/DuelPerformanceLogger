# AGENT CODING GUIDELINES

- Never wrap import statements in `try`/`except` blocks.
- Follow instructions in any `AGENTS.md` files within a directory tree when editing files in that scope.
- Prefer using `rg` instead of `ls -R` or `grep -R` for searching within the repository.
- After making code changes, run relevant tests and include their results when reporting.
- Provide detailed, citation-backed summaries of modifications in final responses.
